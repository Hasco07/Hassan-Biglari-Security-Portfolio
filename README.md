# Hassan Biglari — Security Portfolio (ISSM / ISSO / RMF)

**Cleared security professional (TS) | RMF/JSIG | Audit & inspection readiness | STIG hardening | eMASS | Splunk**

## 30-second summary
I’m an Information System Security Manager (ISSM) with hands-on experience executing the full ATO lifecycle for classified systems—SSP development, control implementation, evidence collection, assessor coordination, POA&M management, and continuous monitoring. I’ve led ISSO teams and built repeatable processes that keep programs inspection-ready, reduce rework, and improve evidence quality.

My focus: **mission-aligned cybersecurity compliance that actually holds up under assessment**.

## Start here (3 pinned repos)
1) **Public ATO Pack (Fictional System)** — _How I structure a real-world authorization package_
   - Repo: `ato-pack-kitsune`
   - Best entry point: `/0_system-overview/` then `/1_rmf-artifacts/SSP.md`

2) **POA&M + Continuous Monitoring Tracker** — _How I operationalize findings, owners, dates, and reporting_
   - Repo: `poam-continuous-monitoring-tracker`
   - Best entry point: `README` → demo GIF → sample export in `/exports/`

3) **STIG Automation + Evidence Pipeline** — _Hardening + validation + evidence bundles_
   - Repo: `stig-evidence-pipeline`
   - Best entry point: `README` → runbook → `/output/evidence-bundles/`

---

## What I do
- Execute **RMF end-to-end**: SSPs, control narratives, evidence mapping, assessor support, and ongoing compliance.
- Drive **continuous monitoring**: vulnerability findings, POA&Ms, scan cadence, status reporting, and inspection readiness.
- Translate requirements into **clear, auditable documentation** that engineers and assessors can both use.

## What I’ve led
- ISSO team leadership (workload prioritization, coaching, quality control)
- Standardized SSP + evidence processes across multiple systems/programs
- Cross-functional coordination (engineering, ops, industrial security, program leadership)

## Roles I’m targeting (Japan / OCONUS focus)
I’m targeting long-term roles supporting mission environments in Japan, including:
- **ISSM / ISSO** (classified systems, RMF/JSIG, inspection readiness)
- **GRC / Compliance** roles supporting regulated/high-assurance environments
- **Security program operations** roles where execution + documentation quality matters

## For hiring managers
**Fastest way to review (10 minutes):**
1) Open `ato-pack-kitsune` and skim the SSP + control narratives (see how I write and structure evidence).
2) Open the POA&M tracker and review the workflow + export format (see how I operationalize remediation).
3) Open the STIG pipeline and review the evidence bundle output (see how I create assessor-friendly proof).

**What this portfolio demonstrates**
- Practical, assessment-minded RMF execution (not just theory)
- Evidence discipline: traceability, naming conventions, repeatability
- Continuous monitoring mechanics: findings → risk → remediation → reporting

**What’s intentionally omitted**
- Any proprietary, classified, customer-specific, or export-controlled details
- Real system diagrams, hostnames, IPs, templates, or screenshots from secure environments  
Everything here is **fictionalized/sanitized** to respect OPSEC and confidentiality.
