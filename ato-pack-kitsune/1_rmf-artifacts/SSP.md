## 1. System Identification
- System Name: IS 2096 Kitsune
- System Owner: Hassan Biglari
- Authorizing Official (fictional): DCSA
- System Type: Local Area Network (LAN)
- System Categorization (fictional): M-L-L

## 2. System Environment
### 2.1 System Purpose
Kitsune is an isolated local network (LAN) used to develop, integrate, and test software that supports classified jet programs. It provides a controlled environment where engineers can build and validate code without exposing sensitive data or connecting to external networks. The LAN is designed to mirror key aspects of the target aircraft/mission systems stack so teams can run builds, execute automated tests, and troubleshoot issues early.

## 4. Control Implementation Approach
- Control narrative style (who/what/how/when)
- Evidence rules (what counts, how often it refreshes)
- Common “reviewer questions” to answer in narratives

## 5. Control Tailoring (Public-safe)

## 6. Control Implementations (Index)
Control narratives live here: `../2_controls-and-evidence/controls/`

Recommended structure per control:
- Implementation statement
- Responsibility
- Frequency / cadence
- Evidence produced (with file paths)
- Notes / common failure modes
