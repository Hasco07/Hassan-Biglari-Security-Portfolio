# Evidence (Fictional)

This folder contains **fictional/sanitized** evidence artifacts referenced by control narratives.

Rule of thumb:
- Evidence should be **dated**
- Evidence should be **traceable** back to a control and a requirement
- Evidence should be **reviewable** (a third party can understand it)

Create subfolders per evidence type, e.g.:
- account-management-sample/
- logging-config-sample/
- patch-compliance-sample/
- change-control-sample/
