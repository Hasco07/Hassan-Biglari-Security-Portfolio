# Inspection Readiness Runbook (Fictional)

## Goal
Be able to answer the “inspection questions” quickly:
- What is the system?
- What controls are in place?
- What evidence proves it?
- What are the known gaps (POA&M) and plans?

## 10-minute readiness drill
1) Open `SSP.md`
2) Open 5 key controls (AC-2, AU-2, CM-2, IA-2, SI-2)
3) Confirm evidence artifacts are present and dated
4) Review POA&M for overdue items and mitigation notes
5) Ensure the most recent monthly checklist is complete

## Evidence hygiene rules
- Dated files
- Clear naming
- No ambiguous “final_v7” filenames
- Paths referenced directly from controls
