# POA&M Workflow (Fictional)

## Purpose
Track findings to closure with clear ownership, dates, and evidence.

## Process (simple)
1) Identify finding (scan/audit/manual)
2) Assign owner + severity + control references
3) Define milestones and completion date
4) Implement fix / mitigation
5) Validate effectiveness
6) Capture evidence
7) Close finding with dated proof

## Quality rules
- Every POA&M item must map to at least one control
- Every status change should have a note/ticket reference (fictional)
- “Closed” requires evidence (path in repo)
