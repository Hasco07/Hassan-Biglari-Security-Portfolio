# System Description (Fictional)

**System name:** Kitsune  
**System type:** Internal mission-support web application (fictional)  
**Environment:** Lab / fictional enterprise environment  
**Data sensitivity:** Replace with your fictional sensitivity labels (e.g., CUI-like, internal-only)

## Purpose (1–2 paragraphs)
Kitsune is an isolated local area network (LAN) used to develop, integrate, and test software that supports classified jet programs. It provides a controlled environment where engineers can build and validate code without exposing sensitive data or connecting to external networks. The LAN is designed to mirror key aspects of the target aircraft/mission systems stack so teams can run builds, execute automated tests, and troubleshoot issues early.
